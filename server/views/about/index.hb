    <h1>The team</h1>
    <p>We are a two member team that works on sitespeed.io in our free time. New contributors and team members are very welcomed!</p>

      <p>I created sitespeed.io late 2012. It’s been a lot of work and incredibly fun! I’m a web performance geek, love the web and think Open Source is the way forward. At day time, I work at Cybercom. At night time I work on sitespeed.io.</p>

        <p>In early 2015 I was awarded for building sitespeed.io by The Swedish Internet Infrastructure Foundation making it possible for me to work full time on the project for three months.</p>

          <p>I’m one of the organizers of the Stockholm Web Performance meetups. We are 400+ members and are always looking for new speakers. If you are in Stockholm and have something to share, ping me on Twitter and see if we can make it happen.</p>

            <p>Having been supporter of sitespeed.io from the sidelines for some time, I joined Peter as we started working on version 3.0. I’ve been working professionally with the web for about 15 years, and open source tools have been an indispensable help all along. Now it’s nice to be able to give something back.</p>

            <p>In my work at iZettle I spend most of my time enabling the dev teams to shine. Working on sitespeed.io is a great complement, letting me get my hands dirty with range of tools and techniques; from controlling browsers with WebDriver to learning how to use Docker.</p>
